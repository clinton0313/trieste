    A :class:`~trieste.model.TrainableProbabilisticModel` wrapper for deep ensembles built using
    Keras.

    Deep ensembles are ensembles of deep neural networks that have been found to have good
    representation of uncertainty in practice (<cite data-cite="lakshminarayanan2017simple"/>).
    This makes them a potentially attractive model for Bayesian optimization for use-cases with
    large number of observations, non-stationary objective functions and need for fast predictions,
    in which standard Gaussian process models are likely to struggle. The model consists of simple
    fully connected multilayer probabilistic networks as base learners, with Gaussian distribution
    as a final layer, using the negative log-likelihood loss for training the networks. The
    model relies on differences in random initialization of weights for generating diversity among
    base learners.

    The original formulation of the model does not include boostrapping of the data. The authors
    found that it does not improve performance the model. We include bootstrapping as an option
    as later work that more precisely measured uncertainty quantification found that boostrapping
    does help with uncertainty representation (see <cite data-cite="osband2021epistemic"/>).

    We provide classes for constructing ensembles using Keras
    (:class:`~trieste.models.keras.KerasEnsemble`) in the `architectures` package that should be
    used with the :class:`~trieste.models.keras.DeepEnsemble` wrapper. There we also provide a
    :class:`~trieste.models.keras.GaussianNetwork` base learner following the original
    formulation in <cite data-cite="lakshminarayanan2017simple"/>, but any user-specified network
    can be supplied, as long as it has a Gaussian distribution as a final layer and follows the
    :class:`~trieste.models.keras.KerasEnsembleNetwork` interface.

    Note that currently we do not support setting up the model with dictionary configs and saving
    the model during Bayesian optimization loop (``track_state`` argument in
    :meth:`~trieste.bayesian_optimizer.BayesianOptimizer.optimize` method should be set to `False`).

    Deep evidential regression is a deterministic deep neural network that seeks to learn the 
    parameters to the posterior higher order deep evidential distributions and has good 
    quantifications of uncertainty at fast speeds in practice (<cite data-cite="amini2020evidential"/>). 
    Furthermore, the deep evidential model can easily separate between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.  
    The model consists of a simple fully connected feed forward network whose final output layer is 
    configured to output the necessary evidential parameters. The model trains using a combination 
    of the negative log-likelihood of the Normal Inverse Gamma distribution and a custom regularizer 
    (<cite data-cite="amini2020evidential"/>) that makes the problem well defined. 

    The dual loss functions are controlled by a single weight coefficient, ``reg_weight`` and although
    the original paper does not explicitly note the use of an iterative search procedure to optimize
    this parameter, the author's original code does, and we include its use here. In practice, it 
    improves performance of the model and makes it less sensitive to the hyperparameter choice.

        Optimization is performed by using the Keras `fit` method, rather than applying the

        arguments to the `fit` method through ``fit_args`` argument in the optimizer wrapper.
        These default to using 1000 epochs, batch size 16, and verbose 0 as well as a custom

        the dataset's observations to leverage a dynamic weighting of the loss function and its

        Returns mean and variance at ``query_points`` for the model.

        The `mean` of the distribution is simply mu whose expectation will be gamma. Deep evidential
        regression is able to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. The aleatoric
        uncertainty is given by:

        .. math:: \mathbf{E}[\sigma^{2}] = \frac{\beta}{\alpha - 1}

        and the epistemic uncertainty is given by:

        ..math:: \mathbf{Var}[\mu] = \frac{\beat}{\nu(\alpha - 1)}
